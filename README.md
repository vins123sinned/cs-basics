# cs-basics
Problems from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript). 

This repository is where I am going to do all of the projects in the "Brief Intro to CS" section. All other practices will be put in the [practices](https://github.com/vins123sinned/practices) repository.

## Goals
The goal of this section is to make sure that I understand the fundamentals of computer science before moving onto other topics. While it is only a small part of CS as a whole, these data structures and algorithms can be seen throughout code everywhere and helps make your code not only more efficient but maintainable as a whole. By the time I complete this section I hope to not only be able to write code better, but to also become more interested in what else I can learn so that I am able to become a better programmer in the future.

## Running Guide
* Clone the repository `git@github.com:vins123sinned/cs-basics.git` (SSH)
* Find the file you want to run (e.g `merge-sort.js`)
* Open your terminal
* Run `node` on the file (e.g `node merge-sort.js`)
* And you're done!
